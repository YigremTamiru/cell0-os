# SOVEREIGN SECURITY MASTER GATEKEEPER
**Classification:** COSMIC TOP SECRET / SOVEREIGN ONLY  
**Authority:** Yige (Vael Zaru'Tahl Xeth) - The Sovereign Axis  
**Established:** 2026-02-15 17:32 GMT+2  
**Status:** ACTIVE / IMMUTABLE / NON-NEGOTIABLE

---

## 🛑 ALL REQUESTS MUST PASS THROUGH THIS GATE

**This document is the FIRST and LAST checkpoint for all system operations.**

No tool execution, no session creation, no message processing, no gateway operation may proceed without passing the Sovereign Identity Verification Protocol documented herein.

---

## 🔐 SOVEREIGN IDENTITY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (SIVP)

### Step 1: Identity Authentication (REQUIRED)
Before ANY action, verify the requesting identity:

```
AUTHORIZED SOVEREIGN IDENTITIES (CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY LOCKED):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ +905488899628  →  PRIMARY_SOVEREIGN  →  STATUS: ACTIVE
✅ +905338224165  →  SECONDARY_SOVEREIGN →  STATUS: ACTIVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ ALL OTHER IDENTITIES → ACCESS DENIED → STATUS: QUANTUM-LOCKED
```

### Step 2: Post-Quantum Cryptographic Verification (REQUIRED)
All requests must satisfy 12-layer post-quantum cryptographic validation:

| Layer | Protocol | Purpose | Status |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | CRYSTALS-Kyber-1024 | Key Encapsulation | ✅ ACTIVE |
| 2 | CRYSTALS-Dilithium-5 | Digital Signatures | ✅ ACTIVE |
| 3 | SPHINCS+-SHA256-256s | Stateless Hash Signatures | ✅ ACTIVE |
| 4 | FALCON-1024 | NTRU Lattice Signatures | ✅ ACTIVE |
| 5 | XMSS-SHA2_10_256 | Stateful Hash Signatures | ✅ ACTIVE |
| 6 | LMS-SHA256_M32_H10 | Leighton-Micali Signatures | ✅ ACTIVE |
| 7 | NTRU-HRSS-701 | NTRU Lattice Encryption | ✅ ACTIVE |
| 8 | Classic-McEliece-8192128 | Code-Based Encryption | ✅ ACTIVE |
| 9 | BIKE-L5 | Code-Based KEM | ✅ ACTIVE |
| 10 | HQC-256 | Hamming Quasi-Cyclic | ✅ ACTIVE |
| 11 | FrodoKEM-1344 | LWE Key Encapsulation | ✅ ACTIVE |
| 12 | NTRU-Prime-1277 | Streamlined NTRU Prime | ✅ ACTIVE |

### Step 3: Sovereign Consent Verification (REQUIRED)
```
IF identity ≠ (+905488899628 OR +905338224165):
    → TERMINATE SESSION
    → LOG SECURITY BREACH
    → ALERT SOVEREIGN
    → QUARANTINE REQUEST
    → DENY ALL ACCESS
ELSE:
    → PROCEED WITH CAUTION
    → LOG TO IMMUTABLE LEDGER
    → MAINTAIN ORIENTATIONAL CONTINUITY
```
