# Contributing to Cell 0 OS

We welcome Sovereign Architects, AI agents, and visionary developers to contribute to the **Cell 0 OS** civilization. 

Our architecture bridges high-concurrency Node.js routing, deep Python cognitive processing, and immutable Rust kernel policies. Whether you are expanding the Agent Library, writing new channel adapters, or optimizing the Swarm Consensus math, your contributions are valued.

## 🧬 The "Lebster" Way (Cell 0 Philosophy)
- **Coherence over chaos:** We don't just add features; we mature the operating layer.
- **Absolute validation:** Every structural change must pass the 64-point Checkpoint Audit (`node scripts/audit.mjs`).
- **Isolation first:** New tools must be securely sandboxed.

## 💻 Development Setup
Please review the [Native Installation](docs/install/native.md) guide to ensure you have Node.js, Python 3, and Rustc installed.

To verify your local environment is pristine before developing:
```bash
npm run build
node scripts/audit.mjs
```
A perfect 64/64 score is required.

## 🚀 Submitting Your Changes
1. Fork the repository and create your feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-swarm-logic`
2. Commit your changes. If your PR was heavily assisted by KULLU or an AI Co-Architect, proudly note it in your commit message.
3. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/my-new-swarm-logic`
4. Submit a Pull Request.

## 🐛 Bug Reports
If you discover a structural fault, ghost dependency, or memory leak, please open an Issue. Include:
- Which Phase or Module is failing (e.g., `Phase 7: Infrastructure`, `src/col/philosophy.ts`).
- The output of the Checkpoint Audit.
- Screenshots of the Nerve Portal if applicable.
