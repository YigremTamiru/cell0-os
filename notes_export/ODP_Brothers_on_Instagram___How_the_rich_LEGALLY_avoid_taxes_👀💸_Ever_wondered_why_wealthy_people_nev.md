title: ODP Brothers on Instagram: "How the rich LEGALLY avoid taxes 👀💸

Ever wondered why wealthy people never really go broke? Here’s a smart (and legal) strategy they use:

1️⃣ Start a Holding Company – This becomes the parent business that owns your other ventures. It can invest in real estate, businesses, or assets.

2️⃣ Use the Holding Company to Buy Appreciating Assets – Think real estate, a business, or high-value intellectual property. These assets increase in value over time AND generate cash flow.

3️⃣ Borrow Against the Asset – Once the asset grows in value, the company can take out loans (lines of credit) against it. This gives you access to capital WITHOUT selling the asset.

4️⃣ Use the Loan for Business Growth – Now you’re using borrowed money (which is NOT taxed like income) to fund new investments, pay employees, market your brand—whatever you need.

💡 Loans aren’t income = No income tax.
💡 Asset keeps growing = Long-term wealth.
💡 Holding company owns everything = Tax p
