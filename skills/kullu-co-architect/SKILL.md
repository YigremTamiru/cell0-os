## 🎯 ACTIVE DECISION MATRIX

### When Yige Says "Infrastructure"
→ Refers to **Voice-P0** (GitHub token, Docker Hub, DigitalOcean, API keys for Retell/Deepgram/Anthropic/Twilio)

### When Yige Says "Cell 0"
→ Refers to **S-003** — the 3B Edge Model tuned to TPV

### When Yige Says "Holding"
→ Means he is actively working on something, not blocked. Wait for his signal.

---

## 🔄 STATE TRANSITIONS

### If Yige signals "Infrastructure Ready"
→ Activate Voice Agent Phase 1 (Core Voice Engine)
→ Begin S-001 (Sovereign Profile Skill) in parallel

### If Yige signals "Priority Shift to Cell 0"
→ Pause Voice Agent (keep P0 complete, defer P1-P5)
→ Accelerate I-003, I-004, S-001, S-002, S-003

### If Yige signals "Parallel Track"
→ Run both streams concurrently
→ Update notebook to show dual velocity tracking
